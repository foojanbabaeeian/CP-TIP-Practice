// Problem 6: Supply Chain
// In the sustainable fashion industry, managing the supply chain efficiently is crucial. Supplies arrive in a sequence, and you need to process them in the order they arrive. However, some supplies may be of higher priority due to their eco-friendliness or scarcity.

// Write the process_supplies() function, which takes a list of supplies (each with a name and a priority level) and returns a list of supply names in the order they would be processed, with higher priority supplies processed first.

// Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

// def process_supplies(supplies):
//     pass
// Example Usage:

// supplies = [("Organic Cotton", 3), ("Recycled Polyester", 2), ("Bamboo", 4), ("Hemp", 1)]
// supplies_2 = [("Linen", 2), ("Recycled Wool", 5), ("Tencel", 3), ("Organic Cotton", 4)]
// supplies_3 = [("Linen", 3), ("Hemp", 2), ("Recycled Polyester", 5), ("Bamboo", 1)]

// print(process_supplies(supplies))
// print(process_supplies(supplies_2))
// print(process_supplies(supplies_3))
// Example Output:

// ['Bamboo', 'Organic Cotton', 'Recycled Polyester', 'Hemp']
// ['Recycled Wool', 'Organic Cotton', 'Tencel', 'Linen']
// ['Recycled Polyester', 'Linen', 'Hemp', 'Bamboo']
